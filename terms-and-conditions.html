                    arbitration shall be governed by the Lagos State Arbitration Law 2009 to
                    the exclusion of any provision of state law inconsistent therewith or which

                    with the substantive law applicable. Strict confidentiality shall govern
                    any arbitration proceedings, any and all information submitted to the
                    arbitrator by the parties and to the decision or award entered by the
                    arbitrator. Any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator. The terms hereof shall not limit any obligation
                    of a party to defend, indemnify or hold harmless another party against
                    court proceedings or other claims, losses, damages, or expenses.

                    of or relating to your use of the APP; provided, however, that a party may
                    request temporary remedies in a court of law having competent jurisdiction
                    to maintain the status quo or to protect goods or property until the
                    arbitration has initiated and the selected arbitrator has had the
                    opportunity to resolve the request for temporary relief.
                </p>
                <p>

                    relating to these Terms of Use and your use of the APP, unless to do so
                    would be impossible or impracticable under the circumstances.
