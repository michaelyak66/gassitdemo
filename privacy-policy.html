                    “Cookies” are small pieces of information (text files) that an App sends to

                    can be used by Apps to make the users experience more efficient. The law
                    states that we can store these cookies on your device if they are strictly

                    may need your permission. To that end, this App uses different types of
                    cookies. Some cookies are placed by third party services that appear on
                    our pages. We and some third parties may use both session Cookies (which
                    expire once you close your browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on
                    your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal
                    and interactive experience on our Services and to market the Services or
                    other products. Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across App’s.
                    The intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the
                    individual user and thereby more valuable for publishers and third-party
                    advertisers. This tracking is done on an anonymous basis.
